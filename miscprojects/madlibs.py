    f"Last week was my birthday. We went to my Grandma's house and had {food_input1} for supper. After that, we all sat in the {setting_input1} to open my presents. The first gift was from my sister, and it was a {noun_input1}. The next gift was from my Mom and it was a(n) {adjective_input1} {noun_input2}. The gift after that was a {noun_input3}. I pretended to be happy--but I already had one of those! All of a sudden, I heard a strange noise. The noise was {adjective_input2} and I couldn't tell where it was coming from. I looked around the room. I stood up and walked {adverb_input1} to the {setting_input2}. I looked in the {noun_input4}. I looked under the {noun_input5}. I found nothing! I realized that everyone in the other room was laughing! I asked my friend, {person_input1}, 'What\'s going on?' I asked my other friend, {person_input2}. They just laughed. I asked {person_input3} but they just {verb_input1} around the room. I heard the noise again. Suddenly, it occured to me--the noise was coming from one of the presents! I opened the gift and inside the box was a baby {animal_input}! What a surprise!"
