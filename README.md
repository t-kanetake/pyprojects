# How I began these projects

My goal with these projects is to build my knowledge and mastery of Python.

  - These projects are not my own. They come from this [FreeCodeCamp video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdy3nh1tn6I&t=3s).

# How to navigate these projects
- There is no specific order to these projects as they do not correlate with each other.
- In each file, I provided comments on what project you are viewing and what each line does.

# Why I built the projects this way
- I strive to condense the code in a readable manner that isn't too cryptic whilst also retaining the readability of Python's syntax.
- I also try to keep in mind the time complexity, whilst also seeking to retain key features of the code.
- With these projects and more to come in the future, I plan to either become a back-end or full-stack developer. That is why Python is my beginning language. As of now, I am unsure if I want to pursue front-end.
