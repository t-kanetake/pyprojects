# How I began these projects

My goal with these projects is to build my knowledge and mastery of Python, simultaneously building a portfolio to display my ability and proficiency.

# Why I chose to build these projects

I chose projects that served my interests, have practical usage in the real world, and give the best practical use cases for syntax and the best understanding of the Python programming language.

# How I plan to proceed with Python

After a firm understanding has been established, I plan on using Python in back-end use cases. Additionally, I plan on learning machine learning use cases in my spare time. With this knowledge, my goal is to become a full-fledged full-stack developer along with other languages and concepts under my belt.
