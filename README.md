# How I began these projects

- My goal with these projects is to build my knowledge and mastery of Python, simultaneously building a portfolio to display my ability and proficiency.

- In each file, I provided comments on what project you are viewing and what each line does.

# Why I chose to build these projects

- I chose projects that served my interests, have practical usage in the real world, and give the best practical use cases for syntax and the best understanding of the Python programming language.

# How I plan to proceed with Python

- I plan on using Python in back-end use cases. Additionally, I plan on studying machine learning in my spare time. With this knowledge, my goal is to become a full-fledged full-stack developer along with other languages and concepts under my belt.
